# Code for BioChemCoRe GC4 Team

The Drug Design Data Resource ([D3R](https://drugdesigndata.org/)) hosts community drug discovery challenges that include goals of pose prediction, ligand affinity ranking, and free energy calculation.
We participated in the ligand affinity ranking aspect of [Grand Challenge 4, subchallenge 2](https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge-4/cathepsin_s), which focused on the Cathepsin S system and 459 ligands.

This is a repository of relevant analysis scripts and methods on our work before the challenge and much exploration that was performed after the challenge.
